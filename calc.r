#This is my calcultaer

#Urn A has 13 white and 14 red balls. Urn B has 9 white and 2 red balls. We flip a fair coin. If the outcome is heads, then a ball from urn A is selected, whereas if the outcome is tails, then a ball from urn B is selected. Suppose that a white ball is selected. What is the probability that the coin landed heads?
#Probability of selecting a white ball from urn A = 13/27
#Probability of selecting a white ball from urn B = 9/11
#Probability of selecting a white ball = 22/38

#Probability of selecting a white ball from urn A given that the coin landed heads = 13/27
#Probability of selecting a white ball from urn B given that the coin landed tails = 9/11
#Probability of selecting a white ball given that the coin landed heads = 13/27
