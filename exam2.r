#Three ducks are hiding in a spooky forest. A search party has been sent out to find them. Two of
#the ducks are standard hiders and have a 70% chance to be caught by the end of the day. The third
#duck is an expert hider and only has a 10% chance to be caught by the end of the day. The ducks
#are anti-social and very spread out, so whether or not one is caught doesnâ€™t change the probability
#that any of the others will. Let X = The number of ducks that are caught by the end of the day.

#Here is a simlutaion to verify E(x) and also Var(x) using empirical methods.
#E(x) = 1.5

    #the probability of the duck being caught.  If the random number is less than the probability of the
    #duck being caught, then the duck is caught.  If the random number is greater than the probability
    #of the duck being caught, then the duck is not caught.  This is repeated for each duck.  
    #The runif function is not a distribution function.  The parameters are: runif(n,min,max)
