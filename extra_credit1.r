#Write a r scipt for the following:
#Run a simulation to estimate the probability of obtaining a total of 14 with f, fair 6-sided, dice.

#Create a vector of the numbers 1-6
myVector <- c(1:6)

#Create a vector for the 100 sample being true.

#Create a vector for the 100 sample being false.
myVectorFalse <- c()


#Find the mean of the false vector
